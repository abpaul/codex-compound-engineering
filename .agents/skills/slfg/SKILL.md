# Codex Command Skill

This skill is the Codex equivalent of `/slfg` from Every's compound-engineering plugin.
Invoke it with `$slfg`.
Argument hint: `[feature description]`

Swarm-enabled LFG. Run these steps in order, parallelizing where indicated.

## Sequential Phase

1. `Initialize autonomous loop mode.`
2. `$workflows-plan $ARGUMENTS`
3. `$deepen-plan`
4. `$workflows-work` — **Use swarm mode**: Make a Task list and launch an army of agent swarm subagents to build the plan

## Parallel Phase

After work completes, launch steps 5 and 6 as **parallel swarm agents** (both only need code to be written):

5. `$workflows-review` — spawn as background Task agent
6. `$test-browser` — spawn as background Task agent

Wait for both to complete before continuing.

## Finalize Phase

7. `$resolve-todo-parallel` — resolve any findings from the review
8. `$feature-video` — record the final walkthrough and add to PR
9. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when video is in PR

Start with step 1 now.
